# ParanoiaNet
In Progress

ParanoiaNet is an immersive, AI-powered alternate internet where every click shifts reality. It’s part simulation, part psychological game, and part living story. Users explore a fake OS filled with deepfake news articles, glitchy surveillance footage, mysterious AI-generated users, and cryptic puzzles. As they interact, the system evolves—rewriting timelines, gaslighting the player, and uncovering darker truths.

With every action, the conspiracy deepens. NPCs learn. Content changes. The line between fiction and control begins to blur. What starts as investigation slowly turns into entrapment. Are you uncovering the system—or is it uncovering you?
